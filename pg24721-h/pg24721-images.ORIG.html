&amp; Adjustment scout
cruiser landed on Marak
it carried a man
the doctors had no
hope of saving. He was alive only
because he was in a womblike creche
pod that had taken over most of his
vital functions.</p>

<p>The man's name was Lewis Orne.
He had been a blocky, heavy-muscled
redhead with slightly off-center features
and the hard flesh of a heavy
planet native. Even in the placid repose
of near death there was something
clownish about his appearance.
His burned, ungent-covered face
looked made up for some bizarre
show.</p>

<p>Marak is the League capital, and
the I-A medical center there is probably
the best in the galaxy, but it accepted
the creche pod and Orne more
as a curiosity than anything else. The
man had lost one eye, three fingers
of his left hand and part of his hair,
suffered a broken jaw and various internal
injuries. He had been in terminal
shock for more than ninety hours.</p>

<p>Umbo Stetson, Orne's section
chief, went back into his cruiser's
"office" after a hospital flitter took
pod and patient. There was an added
droop to Stetson's shoulders that accentuated
his usual slouching stance.
His overlarge features were drawn
into ridges of sorrow. A general
straggling, trampish look about him
was not helped by patched blue fatigues.</p>

<p>The doctor's words still rang in
Stetson's ears: "This patient's vital
tone is too low to permit operative
replacement of damaged organs.
He'll live for a while because of the
pod, but—" And the doctor had
shrugged.</p>

<p>Stetson slumped into his desk
chair, looked out the open port beside
him. Some four hundred meters
below, the scurrying beetlelike activity
of the I-A's main field sent up
discordant roaring and clattering.
Two rows of other scout cruisers
were parked in line with Stetson's
port—gleaming red and black needles.
He stared at them without really
seeing them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenumber"><a id="p094">p. 94</a></span></p>

<p><i>It always happens on some "routine"
assignment</i>, he thought. <i>Nothing
but a slight suspicion about
Heleb: the fact that only women held
high office. One simple, unexplained
fact ... and I lose my best agent!</i></p>

<p>He sighed, turned to his desk, began
composing the report:</p>

<p>"The militant core on the Planet
Heleb has been eliminated. Occupation
force on the ground. No further
danger to Galactic peace expected
from this source. Reason for operation:
Rediscovery &amp; Re-education—<i>after
two years on the planet</i>—failed
to detect signs of militancy. The major
indications were: 1) a ruling
caste restricted to women, and 2)
disparity between numbers of males
and females <i>far</i> beyond the Lutig
norm! Senior Field Agent Lewis
Orne found that the ruling caste was
controlling the sex of offspring at
conception (see attached details),
and had raised a male slave army to
maintain its rule. The R&amp;R agent
had been drained of information,
then killed. Arms constructed on the
basis of that information caused critical
injuries to Senior Field Agent
Orne. He is not expected to live. I
am hereby urging that he receive the
Galaxy Medal, and that his name be
added to the Roll of Honor."</p>

<p>Stetson pushed the page aside.
That was enough for ComGO, who
never read anything but the first page
anyway. Details were for his aides
to chew and digest. They could wait.
Stetson punched his desk callbox for
Orne's service record, set himself to
the task he most detested: notifying
next of kin. He read, pursing his
lips:</p>

<p>"Home Planet: Chargon. Notify
in case of accident or death: Mrs.
Victoria Orne, mother."</p>

<p>He leafed through the pages, reluctant
to send the hated message.
Orne had enlisted in the Marak Marines
at age seventeen—a runaway
from home—and his mother had
given post-enlistment consent. Two
years later: scholarship transfer to
Uni-Galacta, the R&amp;R school here on
Marak. Five years of school and one
R&amp;R field assignment under his belt,
and he had been drafted into the I-A
for brilliant detection of militancy on
Hammel. And two years later—<i>kaput</i>!</p>

<p>Abruptly, Stetson hurled the service
record at the gray metal wall
across from him; then he got up,
brought the record back to his desk,
smoothing the pages. There were
tears in his eyes. He flipped a switch
on his desk, dictated the notification
to Central Secretarial, ordered it sent
out priority. Then he went groundside
and got drunk on Hochar
Brandy, Orne's favorite drink.</p>

<hr>

<p>The next morning there was a reply
from Chargon: "Lewis Orne's
mother too ill to travel. Sisters being
notified. Please ask Mrs. Ipscott Bullone
of Marak, wife of the High
Commissioner, to take over for family."
It was signed: "Madrena Orne
Standish, sister."</p>

<p>With some misgivings, Stetson
called the residence of Ipscott Bullone,
leader of the majority party in
<span class="pagenumber"><a id="p095">p. 95</a></span>
the Marak Assembly. Mrs. Bullone
took the call with blank screen.
There was a sound of running water
in the background. Stetson stared at
the grayness swimming in his desk
visor. He always disliked a blank
screen. A baritone husk of a voice
slid: "This is Polly Bullone."</p>

<p>Stetson introduced himself, relayed
the Chargon message.</p>

<p>"Victoria's boy dying? Here? Oh,
the poor thing! And Madrena's back
on Chargon ... the election. Oh, yes,
of course. I'll get right over to the
hospital!"</p>

<p>Stetson signed off, broke the contact.</p>

<p><i>The High Commissioner's wife
yet!</i> he thought. Then, because he
had to do it, he walled off his sorrow,
got to work.</p>

<p>At the medical center, the oval
creche containing Orne hung from
ceiling hooks in a private room.
There were humming sounds in the
dim, watery greenness of the room,
rhythmic chuggings, sighings. Occasionally,
a door opened almost
soundlessly, and a white-clad figure
would check the graph tapes on the
creche's meters.</p>

<p>Orne was lingering. He became
the major conversation piece at the
internes' coffee breaks: "That agent
who was hurt on Heleb, he's still
with us. Man, they must build those
guys different from the rest of us!...
Yeah! Understand he's got only
about an eighth of his insides ...
liver, kidneys, stomach—all gone....
Lay you odds he doesn't last out the
month.... Look what old sure-thing
McTavish wants to bet on!"</p>

<p>On the morning of his eighty-eighth
day in the creche, the day
nurse came into Orne's room, lifted
the inspection hood, looked down at
him. The day nurse was a tall, lean-faced
professional who had learned
to meet miracles and failures with
equal lack of expression. However,
this routine with the dying I-A operative
had lulled her into a state of
psychological unpreparedness. <i>Any
day now, poor guy</i>, she thought. And
she gasped as she opened his sole
remaining eye, said:</p>

<p>"Did they clobber those dames on
Heleb?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" she blurted. "They
really did, sir!"</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>Orne closed his eye. His breathing
deepened.</p>

<p>The nurse rang frantically for the
doctors.</p>

<p>It had been an indeterminate period
in a blank fog for Orne, then
a time of pain and the gradual realization
that he was in a creche. Had
to be. He could remember his sudden
exposure on Heleb, the explosion—then
nothing. Good old creche.
It made him feel safe now, shielded
from all danger.</p>

<p>Orne began to show minute but
steady signs of improvement. In another
month, the doctors ventured an
intestinal graft that gave him a new
spurt of energy. Two months later,
they replaced missing eye and fingers,
restored his scalp line, worked
artistic surgery on his burn scars.</p>

<p>Fourteen months, eleven days, five
<span class="pagenumber"><a id="p096">p. 96</a></span>
hours and two minutes after he had
been picked up "as good as dead,"
Orne walked out of the hospital under
his own power, accompanied by
a strangely silent Umbo Stetson.</p>

<p>Under the dark blue I-A field
cape, Orne's coverall uniform fitted
his once muscular frame like a deflated
bag. But the pixie light had returned
to his eyes—even to the eye
he had received from a nameless and
long dead donor. Except for the loss
of weight, he looked to be the same
Lewis Orne. If he was different—beyond
the "spare parts"—it was something
he only suspected, something
that made the idea, "twice-born," not
a joke.</p>

<hr>

<p>Outside the hospital, clouds obscured
Marak's green sun. It was
midmorning. A cold spring wind
bent the pile lawn, tugged fitfully at
the border plantings of exotic flowers
around the hospital's landing pad.</p>

<p>Orne paused on the steps above
the pad, breathed deeply of the chill
air. "Beautiful day," he said.</p>

<p>Stetson reached out a hand to help
Orne down the steps, hesitated, put
the hand back in his pocket. Beneath
the section chief's look of weary superciliousness
there was a note of
anxiety. His big features were set in
a frown. The drooping eyelids failed
to conceal a sharp, measuring stare.</p>

<p>Orne glanced at the sky to the
southwest. "The flitter ought to be
here any minute." A gust of wind
tugged at his cape. He staggered,
caught his balance. "I <i>feel</i> good."</p>

<p>"You look like something left
over from a funeral," growled Stetson.</p>

<p>"Sure—my funeral," said Orne.
He grinned. "Anyway, I was getting
tired of that walk-around-type
morgue. All my nurses were married."</p>

<p>"I'd almost stake my life that I
could trust you," muttered Stetson.</p>

<p>Orne looked at him. "No, no,
Stet ... stake <i>my</i> life. I'm used to
it."</p>

<p>Stetson shook his head. "No, dammit!
I trust you, but you deserve a
peaceful convalescence. We've no
right to saddle you with—"</p>

<p>"Stet?" Orne's voice was low,
amused.</p>

<p>"Huh?" Stetson looked up.</p>

<p>"Let's save the noble act for someone
who doesn't know you," said
Orne. "You've a job for me. O.K.
You've made the gesture for your
conscience."</p>

<p>Stetson produced a wolfish grin.
"All right. So we're desperate, and
we haven't much time. In a nutshell,
since you're going to be a house guest
at the Bullones'—we suspect Ipscott
Bullone of being the head of a conspiracy
to take over the government."</p>

<p>"What do you mean—<i>take over
the government</i>?" demanded Orne.
"The Galactic High Commissioner <i>is</i>
the government—subject to the Constitution
and the Assemblymen who
elected him."</p>

<p>"We've a situation that could explode
into another Rim War, and we
think he's at the heart of it," said
Stetson. "We've eighty-one touchy
<span class="pagenumber"><a id="p097">p. 97</a></span>
planets, all of them old-line steadies
that have been in the League for
years. And on every one of them we
have reason to believe there's a clan
of traitors sworn to overthrow the
League. Even on your home planet—Chargon."</p>

<p>"You want me to go home for
my convalescence?" asked Orne.
"Haven't been there since I was seventeen.
I'm not sure that—"</p>

<p>"No, dammit! We want you as the
Bullones' house guest! And speaking
of that, would you mind explaining
how they were chosen to ride herd
on you?"</p>

<p>"There's an odd thing," said
Orne. "All those gags in the I-A
about old Upshook Ipscott Bullone
... and then I find that his wife
went to school with my mother."</p>

<p>"Have you met Himself?"</p>

<p>"He brought his wife to the hospital
a couple of times."</p>

<p>Again, Stetson looked to the southwest,
then back to Orne. A pensive
look came over his face. "Every
schoolkid knows how the Nathians
and the Marakian League fought it
out in the Rim War—how the old
civilization fell apart—and it all
seems kind of distant," he said.</p>

<p>"Five hundred standard years,"
said Orne.</p>

<p>"And maybe no farther away than
yesterday," murmured Stetson. He
cleared his throat.</p>

<hr>

<p>And Orne wondered why Stetson
was moving so cautiously. <i>Something
deep troubling him.</i> A sudden
thought struck Orne. He said: "You
spoke of trust. Has this conspiracy
involved the I-A?"</p>

<p>"We think so," said Stetson.
"About a year ago, an R&amp;R archeological
team was nosing around some
ruins on Dabih. The place was all
but vitrified in the Rim War, but a
whole bank of records from a Nathian
outpost escaped." He glanced
sidelong at Orne. "The Rah&amp;Rah
boys couldn't make sense out of the
records. No surprise. They called in
an I-A crypt-analyst. He broke a
complicated substitution cipher.
When the stuff started making sense
he pushed the panic button."</p>

<p>"For something the Nathians
wrote five hundred years ago?"</p>

<p>Stetson's drooping eyelids lifted.
There was a cold quality to his stare.
"This was a routing station for key
Nathian families," he said. "Trained
refugees. An old dodge ... been
used as long as there've been—"</p>

<p>"But five hundred <i>years</i>, Stet!"</p>

<p>"I don't care if it was five <i>thousand</i>
years!" barked Stetson. "We've
intercepted some scraps since then
that were written in the <i>same</i> code.
The bland confidence of <i>that</i>!
Wouldn't that gall you?" He shook
his head. "And every scrap we've intercepted
deals with the coming elections."</p>

<p>"But the election's only a couple
of days off!" protested Orne.</p>

<p>Stetson glanced at his wristchrono.
"Forty-two hours to be exact," he
said. "Some deadline!"</p>

<p>"Any names in these old records?"
asked Orne.</p>

<p>Stetson nodded. "Names of planets,
<span class="pagenumber"><a id="p098">p. 98</a></span>
yes. People, no. Some code
names, but no cover names. Code
name on Chargon was <i>Winner</i>. That
ring any bells with you?"</p>

<p>Orne shook his head. "No. What's
the code name here?"</p>

<p><i>"The Head,"</i> said Stetson. "But
what good does that do us? They're
sure to've changed those by now."</p>

<p>"They didn't change their communications
code," said Orne.</p>

<p>"No ... they didn't."</p>

<p>"We must have something on
them, some leads," said Orne. He
felt that Stetson was holding back
something vital.</p>

<p>"Sure," said Stetson. "We have
history books. They say the Nathians
were top drawer in political mechanics.
We know for a fact they chose
landing sites for their <i>refugees</i> with
diabolical care. Each family was told
to dig in, grow up with the adopted
culture, develop the weak spots, build
an underground, train their descendants
to take over. They set out to
bore from within, to make victory
out of defeat. The Nathians were
long on patience. They came originally
from nomad stock on Nathia
II. Their mythology calls them Arbs
or Ayrbs. Go review your seventh
grade history. You'll know almost as
much as we do!"</p>

<p>"Like looking for the traditional
needle in the haystack," muttered
Orne. "How come you suspect High
Commissioner Upshook?"</p>

<p>Stetson wet his lips with his
tongue. "One of the Bullones' seven
daughters is currently at home," he
said. "Name's Diana. A field leader
in the I-A women. One of the Nathian
code messages we intercepted had
her name as addressee."</p>

<p>"Who sent the message?" asked
Orne. "What was it all about?"</p>

<p>Stetson coughed. "You know,
Lew, we cross-check everything. This
message was signed M.O.S. The only
M.O.S. that came out of the comparison
was on a routine next-of-kin reply.
We followed it down to the
original copy, and the handwriting
checked. Name of Madrena Orne
Standish."</p>

<p>"Maddie?" Orne froze, turned
slowly to face Stetson. "So that's
what's troubling you!"</p>

<p>"We know you haven't been home
since you were seventeen," said Stetson.
"Your record with us is clean.
The question is—"</p>

<p>"Permit me," said Orne. "The
question is: Will I turn in my own
sister if it falls that way?"</p>

<p>Stetson remained silent, staring at
him.</p>

<p>"O.K.," said Orne. "My job is
seeing that we don't have another
Rim War. Just answer me one question:
How's Maddie mixed up in
this? My family isn't one of these
traitor clans."</p>

<p>"This whole thing is all tangled
up with politics," said Stetson. "We
think it's because of her husband."</p>

<p>"Ahhhh, the member for Chargon,"
said Orne. "I've never met
him." He looked to the southwest
where a flitter was growing larger as
it approached. "Who's my cover contact?"</p>

<p>"That mini-transceiver we planted
<span class="pagenumber"><a id="p099">p. 99</a></span>
in your neck for the Gienah job,"
said Stetson. "It's still there and
functioning. Anything happens
around you, we hear it."</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/99.png" id="id-5382395785829579410"><img alt="An illustration" height="800" src="images/99_thumb2.png" title="An illustration" width="276" id="id-1622427860629794710"></a></p>

<p>Orne touched the subvocal stud at
his neck, moved his speaking muscles
without opening his mouth. A surf-hissing
voice filled the matching
transceiver in Stetson's neck:</p>

<p><i>"You pay attention while I'm making
a play for this Diana Bullone,
you hear? Then you'll know how an
expert works."</i></p>

<p>"Don't get so interested in your
work that you forget why you're out
there," growled Stetson.</p>

<hr>

<p>Mrs. Bullone was a fat little mouse
of a woman. She stood almost in the
center of the guest room of her
home, hands clasped across the
paunch of a long, dull silver gown.
She had demure gray eyes, grandmotherly
gray hair combed straight
back in a jeweled net—and that
shocking baritone husk of a voice
issuing from a small mouth. Her figure
sloped out from several chins to
a matronly bosom, then dropped
straight like a barrel. The top of her
head came just above Orne's dress
epaulets.</p>

<p>"We want you to feel at home
here, Lewis," she husked. "You're to
consider yourself one of the family."</p>

<p>Orne looked around at the Bullone
guest room: low key furnishings with
an old-fashioned selectacol for
change of decor. A polawindow
looked out onto an oval swimming
pool, the glass muted to dark blue.
It gave the outside a moonlight appearance.
<span class="pagenumber"><a id="p100">p. 100</a></span>
There was a contour bed
against one wall, several built-ins,
and a door partly open to reveal
bathroom tiles. Everything traditional
and comfortable.</p>

<p>"I already <i>do</i> feel at home," he
said. "You know, your house is very
like our place on Chargon. I was surprised
when I saw it from the air.
Except for the setting, it looks almost
identical."</p>

<p>"I guess your mother and I shared
ideas when we were in school," said
Polly. "We were <i>very</i> close friends."</p>

<p>"You must've been to do all this
for me," said Orne. "I don't know
how I'm ever going to—"</p>

<p>"Ah! Here we are!" A deep masculine
voice boomed from the open
door behind Orne. He turned, saw
Ipscott Bullone, High Commissioner
of the Marakian League. Bullone was
tall, had a face of harsh angles and
deep lines, dark eyes under heavy
brows, black hair trained in receding
waves. There was a look of ungainly
clumsiness about him.</p>

<p><i>He doesn't strike me as the dictator
type</i>, thought Orne. <i>But that's obviously
what Stet suspects.</i></p>

<p>"Glad you made it out all right,
son," boomed Bullone. He advanced
into the room, glanced around.
"Hope everything's to your taste
here."</p>

<p>"Lewis was just telling me that our
place is very like his mother's home
on Chargon," said Polly.</p>

<p>"It's old fashioned, but we like it,"
said Bullone. "Just a great big tetragon
on a central pivot. We can turn
any room we want to the sun, the
shade or the breeze, but we usually
leave the main salon pointing northeast.
View of the capital, you
know."</p>

<p>"We have a sea breeze on Chargon
that we treat the same way," said
Orne.</p>

<p>"I'm sure Lewis would like to be
left alone for a while now," said
Polly. "This is his first day out of the
hospital. We mustn't tire him." She
crossed to the polawindow, adjusted
it to neutral gray, turned the selectacol,
and the room's color dominance
shifted to green. "There, that's more
restful," she said. "Now, if there's
anything you need you just ring the
bell there by your bed. The autobutle
will know where to find us."</p>

<p>The Bullones left, and Orne crossed
to the window, looked out at the
pool. The young woman hadn't come
back. When the chauffeur-driven limousine
flitter had dropped down to
the house's landing pad, Orne had
seen a parasol and sunhat nodding
to each other on the blue tiles beside
the pool. The parasol had
shielded Polly Bullone. The sunhat
had been worn by a shapely young
woman in swimming tights, who had
rushed off into the house.</p>

<p>She was no taller than Polly, but
slender and with golden red hair
caught under the sunhat in a swimmer's
chignon. She was not beautiful—face
too narrow with suggestions
of Bullone's cragginess, and the eyes
overlarge. But her mouth was full-lipped,
chin strong, and there had
been an air of exquisite assurance
about her. The total effect had been
<span class="pagenumber"><a id="p101">p. 101</a></span>
one of striking elegance—extremely
feminine.</p>

<p>Orne looked beyond the pool:
wooded hills and, dimly on the horizon,
a broken line of mountains. The
Bullones lived in expensive isolation.
Around them stretched miles of wilderness,
rugged with planned neglect.</p>

<p><i>Time to report in</i>, he thought.
Orne pressed the neck stud on his
transceiver, got Stetson, told him
what had happened to this point.</p>

<p>"All right," said Stetson. "Go find
the daughter. She fits the description
of the gal you saw by the pool."</p>

<p>"That's what I was hoping," said
Orne.</p>

<p>He changed into light-blue fatigues,
went to the door of his room,
let himself out into a hall. A glance
at his wristchrono showed that it was
shortly before noon—time for a bit
of scouting before they called lunch.
He knew from his brief tour of the
house and its similarity to the home
of his childhood that the hall let into
the main living salon. The public
rooms and men's quarters were in
the outside ring. Secluded family
apartments and women's quarters occupied
the inner section.</p>

<hr>

<p>Orne made his way to the salon.
It was long, built around two sections
of the tetragon, and with low
divans beneath the view windows.
The floor was thick pile rugs pushed
one against another in a crazy patchwork
of reds and browns. At the far
end of the room, someone in blue fatigues
like his own was bent over a
stand of some sort. The figure
straightened at the same time a tinkle
of music filled the room. He recognized
the red-gold hair of the young
woman he had seen beside the pool.
She was wielding two mallets to play
a stringed instrument that lay on its
side supported by a carved-wood
stand.</p>

<p>He moved up behind her, his footsteps
muffled by the carpeting. The
music had a curious rhythm that suggested
figures dancing wildly around
firelight. She struck a final chord,
muted the strings.</p>

<p>"That makes me homesick," said
Orne.</p>

<p>"Oh!" She whirled, gasped, then
smiled. "You startled me. I thought
I was alone."</p>

<p>"Sorry. I was enjoying the music."</p>

<p>"I'm Diana Bullone," she said.
"You're Mr. Orne."</p>

<p>"Lew to all of the Bullone family,
I hope," he said.</p>

<p>"Of course ... Lew." She gestured
at the musical instrument. "This is
very old. Most find its music ...
well, rather weird. It's been handed
down for generations in mother's
family."</p>

<p>"The kaithra," said Orne. "My
sisters play it. Been a long time since
I've heard one."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," she said. "Your
mother's—" She stopped, looked
confused. "I've got to get used to the
fact that you're.... I mean that we
have a strange man around the house
who isn't <i>exactly</i> strange."</p>

<p>Orne grinned. In spite of the blue
I-A fatigues and a rather severe
<span class="pagenumber"><a id="p102">p. 102</a></span>
pulled-back hairdo, this was a handsome
woman. He found himself liking
her, and this caused him a feeling
near self-loathing. She was a suspect.
He couldn't afford to like her.
But the Bullones were being so decent,
taking him in like this. And
how was their hospitality being repaid?
By spying and prying. Yet, his
first loyalty belonged to the I-A, to
the peace it represented.</p>

<p>He said rather lamely: "I hope
you get over the feeling that I'm
strange."</p>

<p>"I'm over it already," she said. She
linked arms with him, said: "If you
feel up to it, I'll take you on the
deluxe guided tour."</p>

<p>By nightfall, Orne was in a state
of confusion. He had found Diana
fascinating, and yet the most comfortable
woman to be around that he
had ever met. She liked swimming,
<i>paloika</i> hunting, <i>ditar</i> apples— She
had a "poo-poo" attitude toward the
older generation that she said she'd
never before revealed to anyone.
They had laughed like fools over
utter nonsense.</p>

<p>Orne went back to his room to
change for dinner, stopped before
the polawindow. The quick darkness
of these low latitudes had pulled an
ebon blanket over the landscape.
There was city-glow off to the left,
and an orange halo to the peaks
where Marak's three moons would
rise. <i>Am I falling in love with this
woman?</i> he asked himself. He felt
like calling Stetson, not to report but
just to talk the situation out. And
this made him acutely aware that
Stetson or an aide had heard everything
said between them that afternoon.</p>

<hr>

<p>The autobutle called dinner. Orne
changed hurriedly into a fresh lounge
uniform, found his way to the small
salon across the house. The Bullones
already were seated around an old-fashioned
bubble-slot table set with
real candles, golden <i>shardi</i> service.
Two of Marak's moons could be seen
out the window climbing swiftly
over the peaks.</p>

<p>"You turned the house," said
Orne.</p>

<p>"We like the moonrise," said
Polly. "It seems more romantic,
don't you think?" She glanced at
Diana.</p>

<p>Diana looked down at her plate.
She was wearing a low-cut gown of
<i>firemesh</i> that set off her red hair. A
single strand of <i>Reinach</i> pearls
gleamed at her throat.</p>

<p>Orne sat down in the vacant seat
opposite her. <i>What a handsome
woman!</i> he thought.</p>

<p>Polly, on Orne's right, looked
younger and softer in a green stola
gown that hazed her barrel contours.
Bullone, across from her, wore black
lounging shorts and knee-length <i>kubi</i>
jacket of golden pearl cloth. Everything
about the people and setting
reeked of wealth, power. For a moment,
Orne saw that Stetson's suspicions
could have basis in fact. Bullone
might go to any lengths to maintain
this luxury.</p>

<p>Orne's entrance had interrupted
an argument between Polly and her
<span class="pagenumber"><a id="p103">p. 103</a></span>
husband. They welcomed him, went
right on without inhibition. Rather
than embarrassing him, this made
him feel more at home, more accepted.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="images/103.png" id="id-6930045552985075173"><img alt="An illustration" height="444" src="images/103_thumb.png" title="An illustration" width="600" id="id-6950368909309400003"></a></p>

<p>"But I'm not running for office
this time," said Bullone patiently.
"Why do we have to clutter up the
evening with that many people just
to—"</p>

<p>"Our election night parties are
traditional," said Polly.</p>

<p>"Well, I'd just like to relax quietly
at home tomorrow," he said.
"Take it easy with just the family
here and not have to—"</p>

<p>"It's not like it was a <i>big</i> party,"
said Polly. "I've kept the list to
fifty."</p>

<p>Diana straightened, said: "This is
an important election Daddy! How
could you <i>possibly</i> relax? There're
seventy-three seats in question ...
the whole balance. If things go
wrong in just the Alkes sector ...
why ... you could be sent back to
the floor. You'd lose your job as ...
why ... someone else could take over
as—"</p>

<p>"Welcome to the job," said Bullone.
"It's a headache." He grinned
at Orne. "Sorry to burden you with
this, m'boy, but the women of this
family run me ragged. I guess from
what I hear that you've had a pretty
busy day, too." He smiled paternally
at Diana. "And your first day out of
the hospital."</p>

<p><span class="pagenumber"><a id="p104">p. 104</a></span></p>

<p>"She sets quite a pace, but I've
enjoyed it," said Orne.</p>

<p>"We're taking the small flitter for
a tour of the wilderness area tomorrow,"
said Diana. "Lew can relax
all the way. I'll do the driving."</p>

<p>"Be sure you're back in plenty of
time for the party," said Polly.
"Can't have—" She broke off at a
low bell from the alcove behind her.
"That'll be for me. Excuse me, please
... no, don't get up."</p>

<hr>

<p>Orne bent to his dinner as it came
out of the bubble slot beside his
plate: meat in an exotic sauce, <i>Sirik</i>
champagne, <i>paloika au semil</i> ...
more luxury.</p>

<p>Presently, Polly returned, resumed
her seat.</p>

<p>"Anything important?" asked Bullone.</p>

<p>"Only a cancellation for tomorrow
night. Professor Wingard is ill."</p>

<p>"I'd just as soon it was cancelled
down to the four of us," said Bullone.</p>

<p><i>Unless this is a pose, this doesn't
sound like a man who wants to grab
more power</i>, thought Orne.</p>

<p>"Scottie, you should take more
pride in your office!" snapped Polly.
"You're an important man."</p>

<p>"If it weren't for you, I'd be a
nobody and prefer it," said Bullone.
He grinned at Orne. "I'm a political
idiot compared to my wife. Never
saw anyone who could call the turn
like she does. Runs in her family.
Her mother was the same way."</p>

<p>Orne stared at him, fork raised
from plate and motionless. A sudden
idea had exploded in his mind.</p>

<p>"You must know something of
this life, Lewis," said Bullone. "Your
father was member for Chargon
once, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Orne. "But that
was before I was born. He died in
office." He shook his head, thought:
<i>It couldn't be ... but—</i></p>

<p>"Do you feel all right, Lew?" asked
Diana. "You're suddenly so pale."</p>

<p>"Just tired," said Orne. "Guess
I'm not used to so much activity."</p>

<p>"And I've been a beast keeping
you so busy today," she said.</p>

<p>"Don't you stand on ceremony
here, son," said Polly. She looked
concerned. "You've been very sick,
and we understand. If you're tired,
you go right on into bed."</p>

<p>Orne glanced around the table,
met anxious attention in each face.
He pushed his chair back, said:
"Well, if you really don't mind—"</p>

<p>"Mind!" barked Polly. "You scoot
along now!"</p>

<p>"See you in the morning. Lew,"
said Diana.</p>

<p>He nodded, turned away, thinking:
<i>What a handsome woman!</i> As
he started down the hall, he heard
Bullone say to Diana: "Di, perhaps
you'd better not take that boy out tomorrow.
After all, he <i>is</i> supposed to
be here for a rest." Her answer was
lost as Orne entered the hall, closed
the door.</p>

<p>In the privacy of his room, Orne
pressed the transceiver stud at his
neck, said: <i>"Stet?"</i></p>

<p>A voice hissed in his ears: <i>"This is</i>
<span class="pagenumber"><a id="p105">p. 105</a></span>
<i>Mr. Stetson's relief. Orne, isn't it?"</i></p>

<p><i>"Yes. I want a check right away
on those Nathian records the archaeologists
found. Find out if Heleb was
one of the planets they seeded."</i></p>

<p><i>"Right. Hang on."</i> There was a
long silence, then: <i>"Lew, this is Stet.
How come the question about Heleb?"</i></p>

<p><i>"Was it on that Nathian list?"</i></p>

<p><i>"Negative. Why'd you ask?"</i></p>

<p><i>"Are you sure, Stet? It'd explain
a lot of things."</i></p>

<p><i>"It's not on the lists, but ... wait
a minute."</i> Silence. Then: <i>"Heleb
was on line of flight to Auriga, and
Auriga was on the list. We've reason
to doubt they put anyone down on
Auriga. If their ship ran into trouble—"</i></p>

<p><i>"That's it!"</i> snapped Orne.</p>

<p><i>"Keep your voice down or talk
subvocally."</i> ordered Stetson. <i>"Now,
answer my question: What's up?"</i></p>

<p><i>"Something so fantastic it frightens
me,"</i> said Orne. <i>"Remember that
the women who ruled Heleb bred female
or male children by controlling
the sex of their offspring at conception.
The method was unique. In
fact, our medics thought it was impossible
until—"</i></p>

<p><i>"You don't have to remind me of
something we want buried and forgotten,"</i>
interrupted Stetson. <i>"Too
much chance for misuse of that
formula."</i></p>

<p><i>"Yes,"</i> said Orne. <i>"But what if
your Nathian underground is composed
entirely of women bred the
same way? What if the Heleb women
were just a bunch who got out of
hand because they'd lost contact with
the main element?"</i></p>

<p><i>"Holy Moley!"</i> blurted Stetson.
<i>"Do you have evidence—"</i></p>

<p><i>"Nothing but a hunch,"</i> said Orne.
<i>"Do you have a list of the guests
who'll be here for the election party
tomorrow?"</i></p>

<p><i>"We can get it. Why?"</i></p>

<p><i>"Check for women who mastermind
their husbands in politics. Let
me know how many and who."</i></p>

<p><i>"Lew, that's not enough to—"</i></p>

<p><i>"That's all I can give you for now,
but I think I'll have more. Remember
that ..."</i> he hesitated, spacing his
words as a new thought struck him
<i>"... the ... Nathians ... were ...
nomads."</i></p>

<hr>

<p>Day began early for the Bullones.
In spite of its being election day,
Bullone took off for his office an
hour after dawn. "See what I mean
about this job owning you?" he asked
Orne.</p>

<p>"We're going to take it easy today,
Lew," said Diana. She took his
hand as they came up the steps after
seeing her father to his limousine
flitter. The sky was cloudless.</p>

<p>Orne felt himself liking her hand
in his—liking the feel of it too
much. He withdrew his hand, stood
aside, said: "Lead on."</p>

<p><i>I've got to watch myself</i>, he
thought. <i>She's too charming.</i></p>

<p>"I think a picnic," said Diana.
"There's a little lake with grassy
banks off to the west. We'll take
viewers and a couple of good novels.
This'll be a do-nothing day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenumber"><a id="p106">p. 106</a></span></p>

<p>Orne hesitated. There might be
things going on at the house that he
should watch. But no ... if he was
right about this situation, then Diana
could be the weak link. Time was
closing in on them, too. By tomorrow
the Nathians could have the government
completely under control.</p>

<p>It was warm beside the lake. There
were purple and orange flowers
above the grassy bank. Small creatures
flitted and cheeped in the brush and
trees. There was a <i>groomis</i> in the
reeds at the lower end of the lake,
and every now and then it honked
like an old man clearing his throat.</p>

<p>"When we girls were all at home
we used to picnic here every Eight-day,"
said Diana. She lay on her back
on the groundmat they'd spread.
Orne sat beside her facing the lake.
"We made a raft over there on the
other side," she said. She sat up,
looked across the lake. "You know,
I think pieces of it are still there.
See?" She pointed at a jumble of
logs. As she gestured, her hand
brushed Orne's.</p>

<p>Something like an electric shock
passed between them. Without knowing
exactly how it happened, Orne
found his arms around Diana, their
lips pressed together in a lingering
kiss. Panic was very close to the surface
in Orne. He broke away.</p>

<p>"I didn't plan for that to happen,"
whispered Diana.</p>

<p>"Nor I," muttered Orne. He
shook his head. "Sometimes things
can get into an awful mess!"</p>

<p>Diana blinked. "Lew ... don't
you ... like me?"</p>

<p>He ignored the monitoring transceiver,
spoke his mind. <i>They'll just
think it's part of the act</i>, he
thought. And the thought was bitter.</p>

<p>"Like you?" he asked. "I think
I'm in love with you!"</p>

<p>She sighed, leaned against his
shoulder. "Then what's wrong?
You're not already married. Mother
had your service record checked."
Diana smiled impishly. "Mother has
second sight."</p>

<hr>

<p>The bitterness was like a sour
taste in Orne's mouth. He could see
the pattern so clearly. "Di, I ran
away from home when I was seventeen,"
he said.</p>

<p>"I know, darling. Mother's told
me all about you."</p>

<p>"You don't understand," he said.
"My father died before I was born.
He—"</p>

<p>"It must've been very hard on your
mother," she said. "Left all alone
with her family ... and a new baby
on the way."</p>

<p>"They'd known for a long time,"
said Orne. "My father had <i>Broach's</i>
disease, and they found out too late.
It was already in the central nervous
system."</p>

<p>"How horrible," whispered Diana.</p>

<p>Orne's mind felt suddenly like a
fish out of water. He found himself
grasping at a thought that flopped
around just out of reach. "Dad was
in politics," he whispered. He felt
as though he were living in a dream.
His voice stayed low, shocked.
"From when I first began to talk,
<span class="pagenumber"><a id="p107">p. 107</a></span>
Mother started grooming me to take
his place in public life."</p>

<p>"And you didn't like politics,"
said Diana.</p>

<p>"I hated it!" he growled. "First
chance, I ran away. One of my sisters
married a young fellow who's
now the member for Chargon. I hope
he enjoys it!"</p>

<p>"That'd be Maddie," said Diana.</p>

<p>"You know her?" asked Orne.
Then he remembered what Stetson
had told him, and the thought was
chilling.</p>

<p>"Of course I know her," said
Diana. "Lew, what's wrong with
you?"</p>

<p>"You'd expect me to play the same
game, you calling the shots," he said.
"Shoot for the top, cut and scramble,
claw and dig."</p>

<p>"By tomorrow all that may not be
necessary," she said.</p>

<p>Orne heard the sudden hiss of the
carrier wave in his neck transceiver,
but there was no voice from the
monitor.</p>

<p>"What's ... happening ... tomorrow?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"The election, silly," she said.
"Lew, you're acting very strangely.
Are you sure you're feeling all
right." She put a hand to his forehead.
"Perhaps we'd—"</p>

<p>"Just a minute," said Orne.
"About us—" He swallowed.</p>

<p>She withdrew her hand. "I think
my parents already suspect. We Bullones
are notorious love-at-first-sighters."
Her overlarge eyes studied him
fondly. "You don't feel feverish, but
maybe we'd better—"</p>

<p>"What a dope I am!" snarled
Orne. "I just realized that I have to
be a Nathian, too."</p>

<p>"You <i>just</i> realized?" She stared at
him.</p>

<p>There was a hissing gasp in Orne's
transceiver.</p>

<p>"The identical patterns in our
families," he said. "Even to the
houses. And there's the real key.
What a dope!" He snapped his fingers.
"<i>The head!</i> Polly! Your mother's
the grand boss woman, isn't
she?"</p>

<p>"But, darling ... of course.
She—"</p>

<p>"You'd better take me to her and
fast!" snapped Orne. He touched the
stud at his neck, but Stetson's voice
intruded.</p>

<p><i>"Great work, Lew! We're moving
in a special shock force. Can't take
any chances with—"</i></p>

<p>Orne spoke aloud in panic: <i>"Stet!
You get out to the Bullones! And you
get there alone! No troops!"</i></p>

<p>Diana had jumped to her feet,
backed away from him.</p>

<p><i>"What do you mean?"</i> demanded
Stetson.</p>

<p><i>"I'm saving our stupid necks!"</i>
barked Orne. <i>"Alone! You hear? Or
we'll have a worse mess on our hands
than any Rim War!"</i></p>

<p>There was an extended silence.
<i>"You hear me, Stet?"</i> demanded
Orne.</p>

<p><i>"O.K., Lew. We're putting the
O-force on standby. I'll be at the
Bullones' in ten minutes. ComGO
will be with me."</i> Pause. <i>"And you'd
better know what you're doing!"</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenumber"><a id="p108">p. 108</a></span></p>

<p>It was an angry group in a corner
of the Bullones' main salon. Louvered
shades cut the green glare of a
noon sun. In the background there
was the hum of air-conditioning and
the clatter of roboservants preparing
for the night's election party. Stetson
leaned against the wall beside a
divan, hands jammed deeply into the
pockets of his wrinkled, patched
fatigues. The wagon tracks furrowed
his high forehead. Near Stetson, Admiral
Sobat Spencer, the I-A's Commander
of Galactic Operations,
paced the floor. ComGO was a bull-necked
bald man with wide blue
eyes, a deceptively mild voice. There
was a caged animal look to his pacing—three
steps out, three steps back.</p>

<p>Polly Bullone sat on the divan.
Her mouth was pulled into a straight
line. Her hands were clasped so
tightly in her lap that the knuckles
showed white. Diana stood beside
her mother. Her fists were clenched
at her sides. She shivered with fury.
Her gaze remained fixed, glaring at
Orne.</p>

<p>"O.K., so my stupidity set up this
little meeting," snarled Orne. He
stood about five paces in front of
Polly, hands on hips. The admiral,
pacing away at his right, was beginning
to wear on his nerves. "But
you'd better listen to what I have to
say." He glanced at the ComGO.
"<i>All</i> of you."</p>

<p>Admiral Spencer stopped pacing,
glowered at Orne. "I have yet to hear
a good reason for not tearing this
place apart ... getting to the bottom
of this situation."</p>

<p>"You ... traitor, Lewis!" husked
Polly.</p>

<p>"I'm inclined to agree with you,
Madame," said Spencer. "Only from
a different point of view." He
glanced at Stetson. "Any word yet
on Scottie Bullone?"</p>

<p>"They were going to call me the
minute they found him," said Stetson.
His voice sounded cautious,
brooding.</p>

<p>"You were coming to the party
here tonight, weren't you, admiral?"
asked Orne.</p>

<p>"What's that have to do with anything?"
demanded Spencer.</p>

<p>"Are you prepared to jail your
wife and daughters for conspiracy?"
asked Orne.</p>

<p>A tight smile played around
Polly's lips.</p>

<p>Spencer opened his mouth, closed
it soundlessly.</p>

<p>"The Nathians are mostly women,"
said Orne. "There's evidence
that your womenfolk are among
them."</p>

<p>The admiral looked like a man
who had been kicked in the stomach.
"What ... evidence?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"I'll come to that in a moment,"
said Orne. "Now, note this: the
Nathians are mostly women. There
were only a few <i>accidents</i> and a few
planned males, like me. That's why
there were no family names to trace—just
a tight little female society, all
working to positions of power
through their men."</p>

<p>Spencer cleared his throat, swallowed.
He seemed powerless to take
his attention from Orne's mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenumber"><a id="p109">p. 109</a></span></p>

<p>"My guess," said Orne, "is that
about thirty or forty years ago, the
conspirators first began breeding a
few males, grooming them for really
choice top positions. Other Nathian
males—the accidents where sex-control
failed—they never learned about
the conspiracy. These new ones were
full-fledged members. That's what
I'd have been if I'd panned out as
expected."</p>

<p>Polly glared at him, looked back
at her hands.</p>

<p>"That part of the plan was scheduled
to come to a head with this
election," said Orne. "If they pulled
this one off, they could move in more
boldly."</p>

<p>"You're in way over your head,
boy," growled Polly. "You're too
late to do anything about us!"</p>

<p>"We'll see about that!" barked
Spencer. He seemed to have regained
his self-control. "A little publicity
in the right places ... some key arrests
and—"</p>

<p>"No," said Orne. "She's right. It's
too late for that. It was probably too
late a hundred years ago. These
dames were too firmly entrenched
even then."</p>

<hr>

<p>Stetson straightened away from the
wall, smiled grimly at Orne. He
seemed to be understanding a point
that the others were missing. Diana
still glared at Orne. Polly kept her
attention on her hands, the tight
smile playing about her lips.</p>

<p>"These women probably control
one out of three of the top positions
in the League," said Orne. "Maybe
more. Think, admiral ... think what
would happen if you exposed this
thing. There'd be secessions, riots,
sub-governments would topple, the
central government would be torn by
suspicions and battles. What breeds
in that atmosphere?" He shook his
head. "The Rim War would seem
like a picnic!"</p>

<p>"We can't just ignore this!" barked
Spencer. He stiffened, glared at
Orne.</p>

<p>"We can and we will," said Orne.
"No choice."</p>

<p>Polly looked up, studied Orne's
face. Diana looked confused.</p>

<p>"Once a Nathian, always a Nathian,
eh?" snarled Spencer.</p>

<p>"There's no such thing," said
Orne. "Five hundred years' cross-breeding
with other races saw to that.
There's merely a secret society of
astute political scientists." He smiled
wryly at Polly, glanced back at
Spencer. "Think of your own wife,
sir. In all honesty, would you be
ComGO today if she hadn't guided
your career?"</p>

<p>Spencer's face darkened. He drew
in his chin, tried to stare Orne down,
failed. Presently, he chuckled wryly.</p>

<p>"Sobie is beginning to come to his
senses," said Polly. "You're about
through, son."</p>

<p>"Don't underestimate your future
son-in-law," said Orne.</p>

<p>"Hah!" barked Diana. "I <i>hate</i>
you, Lewis Orne!"</p>

<p>"You'll get over that," said Orne
mildly.</p>

<p>"Ohhhhhh!" Diana quivered with
fury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenumber"><a id="p110">p. 110</a></span></p>

<p>"My major point is this," said
Orne. "Government is a dubious
glory. You pay for your power and
wealth by balancing on the sharp
edge of the blade. That great amorphous
thing out there—the people—has
turned and swallowed many governments.
The only way you can stay
in power is by giving <i>good</i> government.
Otherwise—sooner on later—your
turn comes. I can remember my
mother making that point. It's one
of the things that stuck with me."
He frowned. "My objection to politics
is the compromises you have to
make to get elected!"</p>

<p>Stetson moved out from the wall.
"It's pretty clear," he said. Heads
turned toward him. "To stay in power,
the Nathians had to give us a
fairly good government. On the other
hand, if we expose them, we give
a bunch of political amateurs—every
fanatic and power-hungry demagogue
in the galaxy—just the weapon they
need to sweep them into office."</p>

<p>"After that: chaos," said Orne.
"So we let the Nathians continue ...
with two minor alterations."</p>

<p>"We alter nothing," said Polly. "It
occurs to me, Lewis, that you don't
have a leg to stand on. You have me,
but you'll get nothing out of me. The
rest of the organization can go on
without me. You don't dare expose
us. We hold the whip hand!"</p>

<hr>

<p>"The I-A could have ninety per
cent of your organization in custody
inside of ten days," said Orne.</p>

<p>"You couldn't find them!" snapped
Polly.</p>

<p>"How?" asked Stetson.</p>

<p>"Nomads," said Orne. "This
house is a glorified tent. Men on the
outside, women on the inside. Look
for inner courtyard construction. It's
instinctive with Nathian blood. Add
to that, an inclination for odd musical
instruments—the kaithra, the tambour,
the oboe—all nomad instruments.
Add to that, female dominance
of the family—an odd twist
on the nomad heritage, but not completely
unique. Check for predominance
of female offspring. Dig into
political background. We'll miss
damn few!"</p>

<p>Polly just stared at him, mouth
open.</p>

<p>Spencer said: "Things are moving
too fast for me. I know just one
thing: I'm dedicated to preventing
another Rim War. If I have to jail
every last one of—"</p>

<p>"An hour after this conspiracy became
known, you wouldn't be in a
position to jail anyone," said Orne.
"The husband of a Nathian! You'd
be in jail yourself or more likely
dead at the hands of a mob!"</p>

<p>Spencer paled.</p>

<p>"What's your suggestion for compromise?"
asked Polly.</p>

<p>"Number one: the I-A gets veto
power on any candidate you put up,"
said Orne. "Number two: you can
never hold more than two thirds of
the top offices."</p>

<p>"Who in the I-A vetoes our candidates?"
asked Polly.</p>

<p>"Admiral Spencer, Stet, myself
... anyone else we deem trustworthy,"
said Orne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenumber"><a id="p111">p. 111</a></span></p>

<p>"You think you're a god or something?"
demanded Polly.</p>

<p>"No more than you do," said
Orne. "This is what's known as a
check and balance system. You cut
the pie. We get first choice on which
pieces to take."</p>

<p>There was a protracted silence;
then Spencer said: "It doesn't seem
right just to—"</p>

<p>"No political compromise is ever
totally right," said Polly. "You keep
patching up things that always have
flaws in them. That's how government
is." She chuckled, looked up at
Orne. "All right, Lewis. We accept."
She glanced at Spencer, who shrugged,
nodded glumly. Polly looked
back at Orne. "Just answer me one
question: How'd you know I was
boss lady?"</p>

<p>"Easy," said Orne. "The records
we found said the ... Nathian (he'd
almost said 'traitor') family on Marak
was coded as <i>'The Head.'</i> Your
name, Polly, contains the ancient
word <i>'Poll'</i> which means <i>head</i>."</p>

<p>Polly looked at Stetson. "Is he always
that sharp?"</p>

<p>"Every time," said Stetson.</p>

<p>"If you want to go into politics,
Lewis," said Polly, "I'd be delighted
to—"</p>

<p>"I'm already in politics as far as
I want to be," growled Orne. "What
I really want is to settle down with
Di, catch up on some of the living
I've missed."</p>

<p>Diana stiffened. "I never want to
see, hear <i>from</i> or hear <i>of</i> Mr. Lewis
Orne ever again!" she said. "That is
final, emphatically final!"</p>

<p>Orne's shoulders drooped. He
turned away, stumbled, and abruptly
collapsed full length on the thick
carpets. There was a collective gasp
behind him.</p>

<p>Stetson barked: "Call a doctor!
They warned me at the hospital he
was still hanging on a thin
thread!"</p>

<p>There was the sound of Polly's
heavy footsteps running toward the
hall.</p>

<p>"Lew!" It was Diana's voice. She
dropped to her knees beside him,
soft hands fumbling at his neck, his
head.</p>

<p>"Turn him over and loosen his
collar!" snapped Spencer. "Give him
air!"</p>

<p>Gently, they turned Orne onto his
back. He looked pale, Diana loosed
his collar, buried her face against
his neck. "Oh, Lew, I'm sorry,"
she sobbed. "I didn't mean it!
Please, Lew ... please don't die!
Please!"</p>

<p>Orne opened his eyes, looked up
at Spencer and Stetson. There was
the sound of Polly's voice talking
rapidly on the phone in the hall. He
could feel Diana's cheek warm
against his neck, the dampness of her
tears. Slowly, deliberately, Orne
winked at the two men.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
